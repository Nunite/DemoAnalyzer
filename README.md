* Demo parsing is done completely client-side inside the browser (by using [hldemojs](https://github.com/Matherunner/hldemojs/)), nothing is sent to the server.
* Highly experimental, expect bugs.


### Running locally
index.html file can be opened directly in the browser. If you run index.html without a local web server then you can't select .zip/.rar files.
